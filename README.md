## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/Amitkumar-Vaghela/BOOKLIST).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page reloads when you make changes.

### `npm test`
Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, optimizing it for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
Removes the single build dependency, allowing full control over the project configuration. **This action is irreversible.**
